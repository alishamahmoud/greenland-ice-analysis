# Greenland Ice — Sea Level & Climate Implications (2007–2023)

**Summary:**  
Personal research project using satellite data (MODIS, ArcticDEM, TerraClimate, MEaSUREs, GLIMS) in Google Earth Engine to measure sea-ice decline, glacier thinning, and warming trends across Greenland. Built habitat models for polar bears, seals, and walruses to assess climate change impacts.

---

## Key Findings
- Polar bear suitable habitat decreased by ~51% (≈29,500 km² lost).  
- Seal and walrus suitable habitats declined by ~49–50% (≈29,000 km²).  
- Regional warming detected up to **>2°C** between 2007–2023.  
- Glacier thinning and increased ice velocity concentrated on coastal margins.

## Repo Contents
- `figures/` → Maps and charts (e.g., 2007 vs 2023 habitat loss).  
- `scripts/` → Google Earth Engine scripts used to generate analysis.

## Data Sources
- **MODIS (MOD10A1)** — Sea Ice  
- **ArcticDEM** — Elevation  
- **TerraClimate** — Surface temperature & climate data  
- **GLIMS** — Glacier outlines  
- **MEaSUREs** — Ice velocity

## Reproducibility
Scripts are provided in `scripts/`. To run them:
1. Open [Google Earth Engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com).  
2. Copy-paste script (e.g., `ice_coverage.js`).  
3. Adjust years and visualize/export maps.
